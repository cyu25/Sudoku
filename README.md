From implemented Sudoku, it was learned how the number of starting values affect the complexity of the search to find the correct solution for a board.
With less fixed numbers, it was easier for the board to solve, however, more fixed numbers took longer time and decreased the chances for a solution to be demonstrated.
Additionally, the game was extended by using `size` as a parameter to create different sizes of grids. 
Having size as a parameter, I could determine how performance depends on the parameter size, as well as find the minimum number of fixed cells for there to reach no solution.
